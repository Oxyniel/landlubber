    <div class="box" align="center">Hello!<div> Welcome to Landlubber, a website that talks about philosophy and its branches as well as classical philosophers. This website strives to educate those who are interested in these topics. Please excuse the design and format of the site for I am still learning HTML and CSS. All matters of the site may change, and it should be expected for anything to change. Feedback, suggestions, and contact options may or may not come out. The website does NOT follow a schedule as of now and it should not be expected that it wil be updated evenly.  </div> <div> Branches of philosophy: <a href="skepticism.html"> Skepticism. </a> </div>
